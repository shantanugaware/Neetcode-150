Intuition
Brute Force would be to use nested for loops, Smart way would be to test depth of water with highest highs and widest widths possible.

Approach
Be gready and use 2 pointers

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int result = 0;
        int left=0;
        int right=height.length-1;
        while(left<right){
            result=Math.max(result, (Math.min(height[left],height[right]) * (right-left)));
            if(height[left]<height[right]) left++;
            else right--;
            
        }
        return result;
    }
}
