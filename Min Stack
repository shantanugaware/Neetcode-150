Intuition
Desigining min stack, i.e. returning min value in a stack, means maintaining as associative minimum value with every stack value.

Approach
Maintain 2 stacks, one for storing data, and other for storing min value with every value of 1st stack. With this approach, every stack operation would take O(1) time.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(n);

Code
class MinStack {
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    Stack<Integer> minStack = new Stack<Integer>();
    public MinStack() {
        
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        stack.push(val);
        if(minStack.isEmpty() || minStack.peek()>=val)
            minStack.push(val);
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        int val = stack.pop();
        if(val==minStack.peek()) minStack.pop();
        
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return stack.peek();
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MinStack obj = new MinStack();
 * obj.push(val);
 * obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * int param_4 = obj.getMin();
 */
