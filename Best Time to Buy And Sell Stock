# Intuition
Use sliding window to find max consecutive difference between 2 elements of an array. Because, every problem rquiring consecutive itteration and having some arithmetic calculation could possibly be solved using sliding window algo.


# Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0;
        int i=0;
        int j=1;
        while(i<j && j<prices.length){
            if(prices[i]>=prices[j]){
                i=j;
                j++;
                continue;
            }
            else if(prices[i]<prices[j]){
                res = res<(prices[j]-prices[i]) ? (prices[j]-prices[i]) : res;
                j++;
            }

        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
